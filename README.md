- **Error Handling:** Includes structured error responses for smoother user experience.
- **Security:** Implements JWT for secure user authentication, with data validation and sanitization.
  
## Tech Stack

- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime for building scalable applications.
- **Express.js:** Minimal web framework for creating API endpoints.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token):** For secure user authentication.
- **MongoDB**  For storing user and content data.
